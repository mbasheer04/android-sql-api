# android-sql-api
A RESTful API to connect android apps to a MySQL database. 

Specifically, this API connects the PowerCutTracker android app (https://github.com/mbasheer04/power-cut-tracker) to a remote MySQL database. The API uses Representational State Transfer to perform CRUD operations on the MySQL database. The API was built using Java Spring Boot (Spring Initializr) and accepts http requests through port 8080.
